## 💡 How It Works

1. **Reusable Components**: `Navbar`, `Footer`, `RoomCard` used across pages.
2. **Routing**: `react-router-dom` manages navigation between pages.
3. **Responsive Layout**: Flexbox and CSS grid for adaptive design.
4. **Future Expansion**: Placeholder API calls for booking functionality.
